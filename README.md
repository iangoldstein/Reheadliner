# Purpose

On October 4th, 2023, Twitter (X) removed access to headlines in news articles.

# Goal

As of October 5th, 2023, headlines can be restored to the web version of Twitter with the use of a Browser plug-in. Versions are provided for TamperMonkey and for Google Chrome (Unpacked). 
The software is provided as-is. It may not continue to work if Twitter updates its interface to remove metadata information further. 

# Privacy

This is a simple script. No data is saved anywhere (locally or otherwise). Nothing is tracked and nothing is shared.
